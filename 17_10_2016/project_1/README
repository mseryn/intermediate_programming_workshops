In groups of 2 or 3:
Using data in x_y_5773672638_duplicates_NO_ERROR_FOUND.txt and the corresponding description, collect both sets of points.
For the x coordinates, find the median and the mode.
For the y coordinates, find the mean and the range.
For each pair of coordinates, find the biggest difference out of all data.
Print all of these values to the console, and be sure to say what youâ€™re printing!
IE, do:
        X coordinate median = #
        X coordinate mode = #
        Y coordinate mean = #
        Y coordinate range = from # to #
        Biggest difference = # between points # and #

        # to #
